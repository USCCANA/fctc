Hungary,Answer/report not provided,Answer/report not provided,"In Hungary most of the smoking prevention programs for the youth have been operating successfully for years. On the other hand their effectiveness isnt proved by scientific impact assessment.
Owing to this deficiency the impact assessment researches of two promising smoking prevention educational programs were realised recently with the support of the WHO European Regional Office (as part of the WHO Biennial Collaborative Agreement).
The first one is the Smoking Prevention Program in Kindergartens of the National Institute for Health Development. The activity is a curiosity in our country and all around the world because it is available throughout the country free of charge it is systematic and also because the kindergarteners are the target group of the program. According to the results of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2008 the smoking prevention programs should be started under school age. This smoking prevention program is used in more than 1600 kindergartens which is more than 40% of the Hungarian kindergartens. In the last year the program reached 12000 children and at least twice as many adults. The results of the impact assessment showed that the program changed the behaviour and attitudes of the children towards smoking and raised their knowledge regarding the harmful health effects of smoking.
The second one is the impact assessment of the Peer Education Program against Smoking in Schools of the Semmelweis University. The research showed that the prevalence of smoking among the youth decreased four months after finising the program.
English and Hungarian review studies were realised with the main results of the impact assessment researches thus the methodology of these effective smoking prevention educational programs became available for the public."

Republic of Moldova,Answer/report not provided,"question 3.2.6.1: Activities aimed at increasing public awareness on such matters were presented by a number of ministries and organizations as follows:
o	the Ministry of Education reported that tobacco-related matters appear in basic and optional subjects/curricula and in various extracurricular activities for example 
o	in both primary and secondary schools as part of curricula of the protection of the environment and health; biology; and hygiene; 
o	in the curricula of civic education (which is aimed at empowering students and formulation of attitudes against smoking); 
o	in various extracurricular activities (for example smoke-free day is organized in school with presentations discussions contests and sports activities which are presented as alternatives to tobacco use in everyday life);
o	with respect to some extracurricular activities collaboration has been established with local organizations NGOs and UN agencies; 
o	the Ministry of Health reports implementation of activities linked to the World No Tobacco Day each year; in addition workshops were organized in the regions for health workers and information materials on tobacco use and prevention of smoking were sent to local agencies; 
o	the Ministry of Internal Affairs also reported having implemented awareness raising programmes in schools with a focus on implementation and enforcement of the legislation concerning smoking in public and sales of tobacco products to minors;
o	the Ministry of Youth and Sports indicated that the law on young people also focuses on promoting healthy lifestyles among the young people. It also reported implementation of various programmes targeted at young people promoting healthy lifestyles including smoke-free environments. The Ministry is also coordinates the establishment of a network of youth friendly clinics; there are 12 such establishments all over the country which not only provide medical assistance to young people if necessary but also focus on health education. Finally a television anti-tobacco campaign was implemented in 2010 by the Ministry in collaboration with other ministries and agencies; 
o	UNICEF also reported promotion of health-related curricula in schools;
In summary various government ministries implemented various programmes to promote healthy lifestyles including smoke-free life but is unlikely that these projects reached the society as a whole. Less focus was found on cessation of tobacco use and treatment of tobacco dependence. Overall the function of implementing such programmes seem to be scattered among different organizations and seem not to be sustainable. 
question 3.2.6.2: The Campaign on Public Awareness on Tobacco Control was launched on 31 May 2010 and concluded on 1 November 2010. The campaign messages were disseminated mainly through radio (Moldova National radio Vocea Basarabiei) private TV channel (Jurnal TV) roundtables articles in the press; campaign materials (leaflets).

The initiative highlights the benefits of being tobacco-free focussing on 4 areas that resonate with youth namely appearance fitness spending power and the environment. Several programmes and activities have been rolled out under LIUWLU. For example the programmes and media initiatives of the National Tobacco Control Campaigns 2009 and 2010 revolved around the LIUWLU theme. 
In 2011 HPB stepped up its partner engagements using the LIUWLU theme. The LIUWLU messages were included in publicity and collateral materials (eg music CDs magazines online platforms and ambient displays) emcee pointers and poster displays were put up at the event. Besides the messages HPB also had tobacco-free rovers distributing educational collaterals and encouraged smokers to stub out at the partner events. It is estimated that about 380 000 youth were reached out to via the various LIUWLU partner initiatives.
As the LIUWLU campaign theme is favourably received among youth LIUWLU will be the mainstay for youth-targeted tobacco control efforts till 2013. In order to better reach out to youth HPB will be actively seeking partners where LIUWLU key messages will be creatively infused into appropriate youth-targeted initiatives.",Answer/report not provided
