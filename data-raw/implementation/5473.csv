Republic of Moldova,Answer/report not provided,"A number of measures required under the 2007 Tobacco Act actually relate to the implementation of this article. Chapter II (Articles 3 to 5) of this law refer to the production and post-harvest processing of tobacco.

Agricultural inputs involved in tobacco growing are required to maintain and improve fertility of the soil and to only apply technologies which do not have a negative impact on the environment. Further only fertilizers and phyto-sanitary products registered in the country can be used. During the growing or processing of leaf tobacco standard rules of workers health protection and security should be respected. In this regard employment of minors and pregnant women is not allowed in growing harvesting or post-harvest processing of tobacco. 
Similar rules apply to industrial processing of tobacco including manufacturing of tobacco products (Chapter III of Tobacco Act articles 6 to 9). Again the law forbids employment of minors and pregnant women for manufacturing of tobacco products.",Answer/report not provided

Turkey,Answer/report not provided,Oriental tobacco is the main tobacco product cultivated in Turkey. Since the use of fertilizer and pesticides is minimal and no irrigation has been used there is no bad effect on the environment and soil contamination. Tobacco growers have been informed on the usage of pesticides by firms. Based on a study carried out with tobacco growers among Ege and Celal Bayar Universities and TAPDK no tobacco green sickness case has been found. Since oriental tobacco has been dried after being harvested there is no need to use another energy resource and its adverse effect to the environment is limited. Moreover pesticides residues have been regulated by tobacco cultivation purchase and sale contractual arrangement tobacco products from the growers violating the mentioned regulation have not been purchased by the firms. Tobacco products not being purchased have been notified to TAPDK and since 2009 such a notification has not been received.,Answer/report not provided
