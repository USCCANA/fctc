United Kingdom,"In the United Kingdom nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is available as a General Sales List medicine (i.e. it can be purchased in pharmacies and any other shop without a prescription as long as certain conditions are met). NRT products are licensed for the following:

It is indicated to aid smokers wishing to quit or reduce prior to quitting to assist smokers who are unwilling or unable to smoke and as a safer alternative to smoking for smokers and those around them.''
Following a review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in 2005 NRT can now be used by adolescents aged 12 and over pregnant women and people with cardiovascular disease. Full details of the report can be found on the MHRA website : www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pla/documents/websiteresources/con2023239.pdf
NRT is widely available and sales tax has been reduced to the lowest amount permissible to encourage use.
The Government has undertaken to work in collaboration with the public health community to consider what more can be done to help tobacco users who cannot quit or who are unwilling to to substitute alternative safer sources of nicotine such as NRT for tobacco. In support of this the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has produced public health guidance on the use of harm reduction approaches to smoking cessation. We will also encourage the manufacture of safer sources of nicotine such as NRT and the development of new types of nicotine products that are more affordable and that have increased acceptability for use in the longer term.
