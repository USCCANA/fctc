#' @section Reporting on the implementation of the Convention (extract from the website):
#'
#' The WHO FCTC requires each Party to submit to the Conference of the Parties (COP),
#' through the Convention Secretariat, periodic reports on its implementation of
#' the Convention.
#'
#' The objective of reporting is to enable Parties to learn from each othersâ€™
#' experience in implementing the WHO FCTC. Parties' reports are also the basis
#' for reviews by the COP of progress in implementation of the Convention
#' internationally. \[...]
