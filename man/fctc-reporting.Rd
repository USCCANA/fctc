\section{Reporting on the implementation of the Convention (extract from the website)}{


The WHO FCTC requires each Party to submit to the Conference of the Parties (COP),
through the Convention Secretariat, periodic reports on its implementation of
the Convention.

The objective of reporting is to enable Parties to learn from each othersâ€™
experience in implementing the WHO FCTC. Parties' reports are also the basis
for reviews by the COP of progress in implementation of the Convention
internationally. [...]
